This repository contains the implementation of the DCAU-AL Active Learning framework, designed to improve semantic segmentation of satellite imagery under severe class imbalance. The approach prioritizes samples based on unbiased class-wise performance gaps, enabling efficient annotation and achieving near–fully supervised accuracy with significantly fewer labels. The dataset used in this work is publicly available at: https://zenodo.org/records/14622048
. To run the code, simply provide the image paths and configure the required hyperparameters (e.g., number of iterations, epochs, and samples) according to your experimental setup.
